Angular2:

* All filenames should start with lowercase name , followed by camel cases. For e.g. vendorListComponent.ts or vendorListComponent.html
* Try to keep the template file name and the component name similar so its easy to follow

* When dividing a component into list,create, edit, delete components, maintain a consistent way. Some of us put multiple functions into
  a single template separated by *ngIf. This isnt a good approach, its better to keep them separated (Reuse the templates but lets not
  put all functionalities into a single one)

* All Variable names should start with lower case and then followed by camel case.

* All Method names should start with lower case and then followed by camel case

* Put all the private methods at the end and the public methods before that (or the other way). Just maintain an order as otherwise it 
  becomes hard to find out which are exposed methods to the templates

* If you are not sure about Error Messages to provide in the UI, pls check with Raja.
